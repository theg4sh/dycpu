- Send by socket or signal to ask enable cpus for a short time in order to prepare the impending load.
- Daemonize the script instead of manual run.
- Logging cpu state changes.
- Detect load increase in range lower than 60.0% and enable additional cpu to prevent "starvation".
    It may gives faster react on load increase.
- Switch the cores to the next cores in the list after a few hours instead of using first N cores,
    e.g. +0h - 0:1, +1h - 1:2, +2 - 2:3, etc.
    The idea to distribute the load between cores in time to reduce the wearout of each cores.
- Using config file in addition to arguments.
